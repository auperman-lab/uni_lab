4 directories, 10 files
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:entrance macriidanu$ cat scroll 

It is pitch black in these catacombs.
You have a magickal spell that lists all items in a room.

To see in the dark, type:     ls
To move around, type:         cd <directory>

Try looking around this room.
Then move into one of the next rooms.

EXAMPLE:

$ ls
$ cd cellar

Remember to cast ``ls`` when you get into the next room!

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ cat scroll 

# Illusions are strong here.
# It is difficult to tell what is a doorway and what is an object.
#
# The magic spell you use to look can be augmented.
#
# From now on, cast your spell like this:
#
# ls -F
#
# Directories (the rooms of these catacombs) end with a / symbol.
#
# Encounters (programs) end with a * symbol.
#
# You can avoid having to type `ls -F` every time by running the
# following:
#
# alias ls='ls -F'
#
# This is known as a shell or command alias.  With this alias,
# typing simply ls by itself will run ls -F. Try it out!
#
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ alias ls='ls -F'
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ ./treasure 
You have found an emerald **amulet**!

To collect treasure, you must have a variable to hold your inventory.

Create a variable and add your treasure to it like this:

export I=amulet,$I

You can always check your wealth with this command:

echo $I

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ export I=amulet,$I
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ ls
armoury/	scroll		treasure*
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:cellar macriidanu$ cd armoury/
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ ls
chamber/	potion*		scroll		treasure*
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ cat scroll 

# You can interact with items in the room (they end with a *)
# by running them as a command (a shell script).
#
# For example, to collect treasure:
#
# ./treasure
#
# The . (dot) means *don't move*, and the name of the 
# script makes the code run.  This is known as a 
# relative path, and the . means the current room
# (directory).
#
# You may have left treasure in the previous room.
# Go back to a previous directory with two dots,
# which means *take a step back*.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# cd ..

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ ./ treasure 
-bash: ./: is a directory
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ ./treasure 
You have found a gleaming silver **sword**!  You marvel at
its craftsmanship, and you recall tales from your childhood
of the great mystic king Rannismir who bore such a sword to
protect the kingdom from the undead.

Add this item to your inventory:

export I=sword,$I

Remember, you can check your inventory:

echo $I

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ export I=sword,$I
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:armoury macriidanu$ cd chamber/
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ ls
scroll		spell*		statue*		treasure*
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ ./treasure 

You have found a stash of **coins**!  They are old and worn
with age,  but they still gleam in the magickal light
emanating from your eyes.

Prefix this item to your inventory:

export I=coins,$I

Remember, you can check your inventory:

echo $I

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ export I=coins,$I
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$  cat scroll 

# You seem to have reached the end of this hall.
#
# Turn back and try another path.
#
# Remember, to back track one directory, you type:
#
# cd ..
#
# If you are drawing a map of your progress,
# you can always get the name of your working
# directory with this command:
#
# pwd

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ ./spell 
Runes, the language of the ancient mystics that once ruled
this land, are inscribed upon the western wall.

Do you want to read them? y/n  y
You recall the lessons of Caitlyn the Green, who taught you
these ancient letters.

The runes are instructions on how to summon a portal that
will allow you to walk through an invisible door contained
in the wall.

In Bash, a symbolic link (symlink) is a *shortcut* to
another file or directory.  Create one from this room to the
adjacent one:

ln -fs ../../../chapel/courtyard/aviary/hall portal

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ ln -fs ../../../chapel/courtyard/aviary/hall portal
Macriis-MacBook-Pro:chamber macriidanu$ ls

#
# You are in a small library.  There are
# shelves on all sides of the room,
# containing many books and knicknacks.
# Before you, there is a small table
# with a very large book open on it.
#

Macriis-MacBook-Pro:library macriidanu$ ./tome 

You see a large tome on the table, open
to a page in the middle of the book.

Do you read it? y/n  y

The tome appears to be a book of spells.  Here is the
first spell:


View the world in color!

If you have a modern, color terminal, you can view the
output of the ls command in color!  This will still be a
valid command if you don't have a color terminal, you just
won't see colors.  Try this:

alias ls='ls -F --color=auto'

Now when you run the "ls" command by itself, rooms
(directories), scrolls (text files), and encounters
(executable files) should each have different colors.
Depending on the $LS_COLORS variable, many other files will
have different colors too!

You can read more about colors by consulting the
"dircolors" manual.  To read more, type this spell:

man dircolors

In the manual, you can type 'q' (without quotes) to
exit the manual page.

The tome appears to be a book of spells.  Here is the
first spell:


Map the entire dungeon!

You can see the layout of the entire dungeon using the
"tree" command.  You may need to install it as a separate
package, consult your operating system package manager for
details on how to do this.  If you're reading this from the
library, your relative current directory path should be:

entrance/chapel/courtyard/aviary/hall/library

If you run the following command, from the library:

tree -F ..

You should see this:

..
├── library/
│   ├── scroll
│   └── tome*
└── monster*

The "tree" command takes many of the same options as the
"ls" command, including colors and viewing hidden files.  Go
back to the entrance and try it out!

Keep track of where you've been!

Instead of using "cd <room>" and "cd .." to
navigate the catacombs, you can keep track of the
rooms you've been in by using "pushd" and "popd".
"pushd", as the name implies, pushes the directory you
pass as the argument onto the room (directory) stack.
Use it like so:

pushd <room>

The angle brackets mean you specify the room (directory),
you don't type the angle brackets.  To see your current
stack, type the following command:

dirs

This will print out the list of directories on the stack.
The data structure is a known as a stack, because you only
add or remove elements from the top of the stack, it is also
known as a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.  To
remove the top room (directory) from the stack, and change
directory to the new directory on the top of the stack, use
"popd", like so:

popd

This will remove the top element of the stack ("pop" it off the
stack), and change directory to the next top of the stack.

Here's an example.  You're in a room (directory) called
~/bashcrawl/entrance/field/, with the following
other rooms:

cemetary/ jail/ oubliette/

To change directory to the cemetary, and place it on the directory
stack, use this:

pushd cemetary

Now, the directory stack (output of the "dirs" command),
shows this:

~/bashcrawl/entrance/field/cemetary ~/bashcrawl/entrance/field

...and your current directory (present working directory,
held in the $PWD variable) is the cemetary.  To go back to
the field, run "popd".  The directory stack will return to
~/bashcrawl/entrance/field, and your current directory will
be that directory.  You can mix and match "pushd" with "cd",
and only the directories you add with "pushd" will be on the
stack.  This is useful for returning to another directory,
after exploring the rest of the dungeon.

Good luck!

Use emacs mode to navigate the command prompt (CLI)!

By default, in Bash, emacs mode is enabled.  If it is not
enabled you can run this in your shell:

set -o emacs

This allows you to move the cursor in the shell faster than
using the arrow keys alone.  Specific command key
chords/combinations can be used, like so:

- Ctrl-a:  move cursor to the beginning of the line
- Ctrl-e:  move cursor to the end of the line
- Meta-b:  (or Alt-b), move backward one word
- Meta-f:  (or Alt-f), move forward one word
- Ctrl-u:  Cut from cursor to beginning of line
- Ctrl-k:  Cut from cursor to end of line
- Ctrl-w:  Cut previous word
- Ctrl-y:  Paste what you just cut with Ctrl-u, Ctrl-k, or
           Ctrl-w
- Ctrl-_:  Undo last cut (may not work in all terminals)

Now you can navigate the shell like a pro!
